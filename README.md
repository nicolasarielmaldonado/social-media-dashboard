## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

The challenge [Social media dashboard with theme switcher challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-media-dashboard-with-theme-switcher-6oY8ozp_H) was to recreate this. I decided to add a bit more, like a randomized data generator through faker.js, I also added the code to make some elements correspond to the data presented, and a bit of animation work.

I made it using React.js and Tailwind.css, although it was my first shot at using Tailwind, I find it really intuitive and fun to use.

Originally I tried the idea of taking the social media data directly trough an API, but failed at finding one that gives me information about followers and the like. (I wasn't aware that it was not possible to take it directly from Facebook,Twitter or the Instagram API anymore).
